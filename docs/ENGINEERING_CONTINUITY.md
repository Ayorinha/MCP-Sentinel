# AYORAI Engineering Continuity

> This document is the project's engineering contract and continuity record.

## Project role
This repository is one component of the AYORAI Applied Intelligence ecosystem.

## Engineering layers
1. Foundation — package structure, configuration and dependencies.
2. Core Engineering — domain logic, interfaces, errors and extensibility.
3. Testing — unit, integration, regression and edge-case coverage.
4. Quality Engineering — formatting, linting, type checking and static analysis.
5. AI Engineering — models, RAG, agents, evaluation or document intelligence as applicable.
6. AI Safety — authorization, adversarial testing, data protection and abuse resistance as applicable.
7. Observability — logs, traces, metrics, provenance and reproducibility.
8. Performance — latency, throughput, memory and quality benchmarks.
9. Integration — stable contracts with other AYORAI components.
10. Production Engineering — APIs, containers, health checks, resilience and configuration.
11. DevSecOps — CI/CD, dependency and security gates.
12. Documentation — architecture, ADRs, examples and troubleshooting.
13. Open Source Engineering — contribution workflow, issues, PRs, reviews and releases.
14. Research & Evaluation — reproducible experiments, datasets, metrics and limitations.
15. Engineering Governance — explicit architectural decisions, acceptance criteria and evidence.

## Evolution rule
Do not treat a passing CI as proof that the project is complete. Each meaningful capability must have implementation evidence, tests and appropriate documentation. Changes should evolve through small, reviewable commits and pull requests.

## Ecosystem position
 MCP and AI tool security gateway

## Current mission
AI Safety layer: mediates tool/MCP calls through explicit authorization policies, default-deny behavior, auditability and adversarial security tests.

## Roadmap
- Complete and validate the current foundation.
- Strengthen core functionality with production-grade error handling and interfaces.
- Add tests, quality gates and security checks appropriate to the component.
- Add benchmarks/evaluation where measurable.
- Integrate with other AYORAI components through explicit contracts.
- Document architecture decisions and operational behavior.
- Prepare contribution workflows only after technical validation is stable.

## Definition of done
A capability is considered complete only when implementation, tests, validation/benchmark evidence where applicable, documentation and CI evidence are present.
